### SIP: Call blocked by Twilio

 The destination number is blocked by Twilio.

The outbound call to the destination number was blocked by Twilio. Potential causes may be:
- The destination has a high-risk of fraud
- Due to regulatory reasons, the destination cannot be reached
- You are placing a call to a +1 destination and your account is missing a Primary Customer Profile

#### Possible Solutions
Potential solutions may be:
- If your destination is being incorrectly identified as high-risk of fraud and you have a legitimate need to call this number, please reach out to Twilio Support through the [Console](https://console.twilio.com) or [Help Center](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us).

### Error communicating with your SIP communications infrastructure

Twilio received a SIP error while communicating with your communications infrastructure specified in either your Trunking Origination URI(s), or Dial SIP URI. There was a problem communicating with a specific endpoint of your SIP communications infrastructure. This means there was either a lack of timely response, an error response or an invalid response from your SIP endpoint. This may result in increased call setup times or even failed call depending on the failover configuration for your Elastic SIP Trunk or SIP application. Twilio will make multiple attempts to deliver calls to your endpoint and each failed attempt will have its own notification.
The notification will have details about the specific error response and the SIP URI that causes the failure.

#### Possible Causes
* Your SIP endpoint is not reachable due to network connectivity issue between Twilio and your system
* Your SIP endpoint is not responding (service down or maintenance) 
* There is a firewall in your network that is blocking SIP traffic from Twilio
* Your SIP endpoint is sending an error response, such as SIP 500 response.
* The SIP URI specified in your Trunking Origination URI, <Dial> <SIP> TwiML or REST API call is invalid
* Your SIP endpoint does not support TLSv1.2

#### Possible Solutions
* Ensure the SIP URI used in the request is correctly configured.
 * For details on how to configure your Origination URIs for SIP trunking, please see [Origination settings](/docs/sip-trunking#origination).
 * For SIP interfaces verify that your SIP URI in your <Dial> <SIP> TwiML or REST API call, see [Receiving SIP from Twilio](/docs/voice/api/receiving-sip).
* Ensure you've allowed Twilio's IP address ranges and ports on your firewall for SIP signalling and RTP media traffic, see [IP addresses - Trunking](/docs/sip-trunking#ip-addresses) or [IP addresses - SIP Interface](/docs/voice/api/sip-interface#ip-addresses)
* Ensure that your SIP servers are running properly and is properly processing calls from Twilio.
* Ensure that your SIP servers support TLSv1.2, or configure your account to allow TLSv1.0+"#,

###  SIP: Source IP address not in ACL

#### Possible Causes 
*  Authorization failure - source IP Address not in ACL (Access Control List).

#### Possible Solutions
*  There is an ACL on your trunk and you are sending us INVITE requests from an IP address not on that ACL. Either fix local routing so that you are sending us SIP from an address already in your ACL or add this other address to your ACL. "#,

### Trunk Validation Error

 

#### Possible Causes
* Cannot use another account's SID as the Termination URI for this Trunk
* Cannot create more than one Trunk with the same Termination URI
* Credential List or IP-ACL already associated with Trunk

#### Possible Solutions
*  Please update your Trunk settings to avoid the conditions stated above. Learn more: [Configure Trunks](/docs/sip-trunking#configure-trunks)."#,

### SIP: No valid Origination URIs configured

 Your call can't be completed because no valid/active origination URLs could be found for your Elastic SIP Trunk or BYOC Trunk.

#### Possible Causes

### SIP: Invalid From number (caller ID)

 You attempted to initiate an outbound phone call or message, but the 'From' parameter you supplied was not a valid phone number or alphanumeric sender ID.

Twilio accepts phone numbers in [E.164 format](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-e164) (i.e. "+1 format"), 10-digit US and Canadian numbers with any combination of non-digit separators, or Alphanumeric Sender IDs (SMS only) with up to 11 alphanumeric characters [a-zA-Z0-9]. Refer to [this page](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223133867-Using-Alphanumeric-Sender-ID-with-Messaging-Services) for acceptable characters.

The number must not be on a do-not-originate (DNO) list, and Alpha Sender IDs may not be generic.

#### Possible Causes
* You have supplied a phone number that was not in [E.164 format](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-e164)
* Your `From` phone number is on a do-not-originate (DNO) list

#### Possible Solutions
* Ensure your number is formatted in [E.164 format](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-e164)
