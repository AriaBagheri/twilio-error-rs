### Conflicting update

 Raised whenever an update is requested while another update is already in progress.	

#### Possible Causes
 * You cannot change a SIM's status or its Rate Plan while another update is already in progress.

#### Possible Solutions
 * Verify that there is not an update already in progress for the SIM. If an update is in progress, the SIM's status will be either `scheduled` or `updating` and you will need to wait for it to finish before you can make additional updates to the SIM's status or Rate Plan.
