### Unexpected event while processing Widget

 An unexpected event was received while processing a widget. Studio ignored this event and did not transition to another widget because there was no matching transition available to handle the event. 

*Note:* If the Execution ended correctly, this warning can be ignored.

#### Possible Causes
* A new call, message, or REST API Execution was initiated for a contact address (e.g. phone number) that already has an active Execution.
* An event came in while processing a widget that cannot handle that event (e.g. incoming message received during Run Function widget).
* A hangup for a phone call was detected while processing a widget that does not have a "Hangup" transition (e.g. HTTP Request or Send Message).
* There was no transition that matched the received event.

#### Possible Solutions
* Incoming Calls only: Enable [Concurrent Calls](https://www.twilio.com/docs/studio/user-guide#handling-concurrent-calls-from-the-same-number-in-studio) in the Flow's Trigger widget.
* REST API-triggered Executions: Use [Studio REST API v2](https://www.twilio.com/docs/studio/rest-api/v2/execution#create-a-new-execution) to create Executions and end any that are still active for the same contact.
* Return results for Function calls and HTTP requests quickly.
* End any [stuck Executions](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019383714-Understanding-and-Avoiding-Stuck-Executions-in-Twilio-Studio) via Twilio Console."#,
            TwilioStudioError::ErrorCode81026 => r#"## ERROR - 81026

### Studio Execution failed because Flow exceeds maximum allowed widgets

 The Execution failed because the cumulative number of widgets in your Studio Flow and all its linked Subflows exceeds the maximum allowed widget count of 2,000. All Executions for this Flow will fail until you reduce the number of widgets to 2,000 or fewer.

#### Possible Causes
* Too many widgets in your Subflows
* Subflows reused too many times in a parent Flow

#### Possible Solutions
* Reduce the number of widgets in your Subflows"#,
            TwilioStudioError::ErrorCode81007 => r#"## Error - 81007

### Connecting to a Call timed out
Studio timed out while executing the Connect Caller widget in the Flow.

#### Possible Causes
* The call could not be completed before the end of the timeout period.

#### Possible Solutions
* Check the Widget configuration. Are all fields filled out correctly?"#,

### Error parsing type in Studio widget

 An error occurred when Studio attempted to parse a type in a widget

#### Possible Causes
* Tried to convert a variable to an incompatible type (e.g. "foo" to JSON Object type)
* The provided JSON string is not valid

#### Possible Solutions
* Verify the runtime data of your flow execution by checking the Flow Data and inspecting any variables you may have referenced
* Ensure that the configured type matches the variable data."#,
            TwilioStudioError::ErrorCode81014 => r#"## ERROR - 81014

### There was an internal error while processing an HTTP request

 An internal error occurred while Studio was executing an HTTP Request widget. 

#### Possible Causes
* Parameter name uses a reserved word, e.g. "method"
* URL was set to a Liquid variable that did not evaluate to a valid URL at runtime
* A transient internal error occurred

#### Possible Solutions
* Remove reserved words from the parameter names, e.g. "method"
* Check Flow logs to ensure a valid URL is being used in Liquid variables
* Retry the request
* Check [Twilio Status](https://status.twilio.com/)
* Contact [Twilio Support](https://www.twilio.com/help/contact)"#,

### Twilio phone number using deprecated API version

Studio does not support 2008-08-01 API The Twilio phone number connected to your Studio Flow is configured for the deprecated 2008-08-01 API, which is not compatible. Update the phone number API version to 2010-04-01.

#### Possible Causes
The Twilio phone number is configured for the 2008-08-01 API

#### Possible Solutions
Update the phone number API version to 2010-04-01"#,

### Studio Flow exceeds maximum allowed widgets

 The cumulative number of widgets in your Studio Flow and all its linked Subflows exceeds the maximum allowed widget count of 2,000. You must reduce the number of widgets to 2,000 or fewer to prevent future Executions from failing.

#### Possible Causes
* Too many widgets in your Subflows
* Subflows reused too many times in a parent Flow

#### Possible Solutions
* Reduce the number of widgets in your Subflows"#,

### Error on Twilio Function response
There was an error in the response back from a Twilio Function attached to the Studio flow.

#### Possible Causes
